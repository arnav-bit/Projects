This is the project space for MySQL projects.

## Project 1 - IMDB Analysis

I used an open source IMDB dataset to conduct extensive analysis of movies, actors, ratings and revenues. I used datasets to get aggregated information using GROUP BY. Further, I created a view for a joint dataset I used more often than others.

Some examples follow:

1. Number of movies and their average duration over years

2. Number of movies and average duration by countries

3. Creating a view to map actors to their respective movies

## Project 2 - Retail Store Analysis
This project is fairly simpler, with just one dataset, tackling multiple questions on the customer - product preferences.

This project uses SQL concept such as GROUP BY, HAVING, Views, Joins within the same table and more.
The final questions is an introduction to market basket analysis where we can see what products are often bought together by the consumers.
