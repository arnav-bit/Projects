# AnalyticsProject
Workspace of my Data and Business analysis projects conducted using a wide variety of tools

## [Ubisoft Weak Signals - Python, SPSS](https://github.com/Zaidf97/AnalyticsProject/tree/main/Ubisoft_Weak_Signals)
During this academic project, I mainly learnt how to conduct NLP on textual data, to tokenize them, clean and process them and eventually use them to create wordclouds of relevant data, to understand the key discussion topics in the community.

## [Amusement Park Machine Learning Project - Python](https://github.com/Zaidf97/AnalyticsProject/blob/main/ModelsOfMarketing/amusementModel.ipynb)
As part of my current coursework in Analytics, I have taken up several python based projects. One such project was to create an optimal machine learning model using a given dataset where we can estimate the overall score given by consumers to an amusement park based on factors such as price, wait time, distance, number of kids and more.
I used the statsmodel.api library to create a log regression model and I achieved an R-squared value of 82.2%

<img width="962" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-22 at 11 09 18" src="https://github.com/Zaidf97/AnalyticsProject/assets/48427733/a66735d1-3c1e-4956-97e9-8b061b7a3234">


## [Spotify Music Data - Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/SpotifyDash_16771858113360/Story1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
Being an avid music listener and playing the guitar for as long as I could remember, it is a surprise I didn't pick this project earlier. I found this dataset as part of another Python project to analyse and viusalise data, however I thought it could be a good fit for a tableau project.

The data contains various fields from a Spotify Datset, including the track name, artists, genres, key of the song, Major/minor mode and some significant measures such as duration, popularity, loudness, tempo, liveness etc. 
I created several dashboard to present the data, specially the split by popular genres and made a story with relevant visualisations grouped up.

Since the dataset was huge in size, slowing down the system, I took a random sample extract of the dataset which boiled down the data to 1000 rows.

***Story 1***

![Screenshot 2023-02-26 at 12 53 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/221408845-d36a6e87-53d2-47c6-81e6-c4fb9046bfef.png)
While I don't really agree with the 'most popular' songs in the list (although that is my personal bias, and fortunately data has no bias), this visualiastion is a simple search list to find your favourite songs/artists using a parameter search box.

***Story 2***

![Screenshot 2023-02-26 at 13 05 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/221409418-8814fa9b-87e1-4963-aa27-f47bd080795f.png)
This story takes in a couple of visualisations centered around genres and keys. I have used interactive filters to help deep dive into a specific genre. The top left graph lists down the genres with the most number of songs in them. The second one describes the keys used in those songs.
Thus filtering on a genre in the top left graph will tell you the most popular keys used in those songs. 
Similarly the bottom right graphs reduces to the list of popular songs in that genre.

The bottom left graph gives the average duration in these genres.
![Screenshot 2023-02-26 at 13 10 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/221409671-5950ac1b-b768-4d4a-9f43-9efb864ebb57.png)


Doing a simple analysis here, we can infer that in our sample, Blues has the most number of songs with the most popular keys being C and D with an average duration of 250 seconds, with Seven Nation Army taking the top song (looks like they forgot S.R.V. or B.B King)

***Story 3***
![Screenshot 2023-02-26 at 13 11 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/221409699-00a29af5-2e82-4d4b-b91a-3acde9757678.png)


This story gives a glimpse into popularity of songs by their keys and genres. The songs in A are the most popular with Rap being the most popular genre (yikes).

![Screenshot 2023-02-26 at 13 19 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/221410092-c0cb8af3-c0e4-4f7f-b029-f23fd53c0d51.png)

In the Rock Genre, the most popular songs are in the key of F# and G with almost 92% of the songs in the 4/4 time signature, the most common one.


## Retail Store Analysis - SQL
This is a basic project created using SQL, where I am analysis data from a retail store to identify the high value consumers, consumers who purchase unique products and combination of items bought often by consumers, thus giving an introduction to market basket analysis.



<img width="943" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-31 at 14 08 57" src="https://github.com/Zaidf97/AnalyticsProject/assets/48427733/9af35535-7b81-4ebe-b6e5-8c6eb5e93f08">


This query creates a view so that common data can be accessed easily without creating the column multiple times.

<img width="864" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-31 at 14 09 28" src="https://github.com/Zaidf97/AnalyticsProject/assets/48427733/4e816a96-9443-4975-84fe-f65ff1b90e38">


This subquery tells us how many unique products were purchased by the consumer.

<img width="936" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-31 at 14 10 34" src="https://github.com/Zaidf97/AnalyticsProject/assets/48427733/36512609-3feb-4d17-bb2e-6bb91c8ddfa5">


This query tells us which products are commonly purchased together by the consumers.

## [Regional Sales Performance across 3 different data sheets - Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesCourse/Story1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Created this simple project using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zaid.farooqui2160) where I am analysing the sales performance of a company selling various items distributed across assortments (phones, electronics, etc), Colors, Classficiations (A,B, etc).
This project follows the entire Tableau life cycle, right from importing the data (3 different tables), [blending the data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73229666/tableau-what-is-the-different-between-relationship-and-data-blending) creating various sheets, dashboards and finally a story to look at all the crucial information at a glance.

Tableau obviously provides you an opportunity to make interactive dashboards, where you can filter a sheet and see how it impacts the other sheets in the dashboards. A simple example below :

***Story 1***

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/212544891-8118ab21-0024-4307-9528-82773f62c305.png)
In the image above, you can see I have used the Geomap as a filter. The Geomap itself gives information on the sales and store velocity (Sales/ number of stores in that state). Store velocity is a better measure of sales performance rather than absolute value.

A KPI board gives key information about sales, stock %, average inventory and more.
Moreover, another dashboard gives sales performance across assortments and classifications in %.

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/212544992-77dec5df-90fd-4817-b5a4-76f43b9ceab1.png)

In this second image, we can see that by clicking on a state (South Carolina), we can see the data for only that state. Sales, inventory, stock % and more are updated.

***Story 2***

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/212546481-4f31bf01-2c88-4897-bdf6-a832f9960524.png)

In the second dash of the story, we look performance across the time period, in this case on a weekly basis. Top KPI charts give you the sales and inventory while the graph on the top left looks at performance of assortments. Key insights can be drawn in this case, such as the sales of phones has increased in the later weeks. I have added trend lines to point out the future direction of sales, indicating phones to overtake and keep increasing more than the other 2 assortments.

The bottom dashboard is an important one. The Demand Planning Dashboard tells you the sales vs average inventory on hand throughout the weeks. This data can be granulated by adding item IDs, States, classification depending on the use case.

The parabolic shape created in the demand planning dashboard is the forecast of sales and average inventory on hand. Key insights can be the inventory on hand is going to reduce while sales might increase. This can help the managers adapt their planning.

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/212545690-5778802d-2f77-4f13-b94a-f3085270b3fb.png)

In this dash, I have added a week slider, where you can check out the performance at a particular week/month. Again, being interactive the dashboard gives you the snapshot of all the graphs at a particular week just by changing the slider.


***Story 3***

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/212545903-92f09004-645b-48df-aee5-c92ccea743e2.png)

The last dashboard in my story focuses on each item ID. The top KPI dash gives key information, the bottom left dash, Item performance by Week, gives sales values by classification across the weeks and the final graph is a scatter plot of sales vs average inventory on hand. I have created clusters in this data to better understand the different categories. Items having low sales but high inventory on hand are not good for business and they can be removed, focus should be on items giving high sales and a similar or higher inventory on hand.

I have added a filter for each item. Hence we can look at the performance for an individual item or aggregate multiple items.

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/212545928-90d0c8c3-a252-432a-b450-773de80e888f.png)
In the above image, we can notice the number of cluster changes depending on the item. We can conclude the plots in orange color are ideal since they are giving decent sales for the inventory. Red plots indicate really low sales but a high inventory on hand. Such items can be stopped.

The first project, sales analysis is a PowerBI dashboard created from a sales data. The data had various fields such as categories, sub-categories, product, location, sales and profit.

I created a dynamic automated dashboard on PowerBI Pro Service, where you can interact with the data. This means that if you click on any of the graph data, the other data on the dashboard changes to represent that data. (Note: The document I uploaded is a PDF File, hence you cannot interact with it here, for that you need my PowerBI workspace access).
Secondly, I have divided the report into various categories, the first one listing sales and profit by month. The next one is by categories and sub categories, giving you the option to drill down into the data and analyse it at a granular level. The 3rd one is a map data, giving out profit and sales by U.S. States and the 4th one lists down quantity as a product of categories and sub categories.

This dashboard helps the user identify the top performing states, the highest grossing products and categories and the season where the business booms.

Cricket is considered a religion in India, probably the largest. So it only seemed fitting to create a project on this. IPL, the [Indian Premiere League] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) is the world's largest league cricket tournament, held in India year after year. My analysis on this project ranged from analysing Batsmens', Bowlers' statistic over 10 years, the teams progress and the number of matches won/lost and the tosses as well.

This was a challenging project, with over 5 dataset related to each other, analysing the data and creating reports on them was a task which took me quite a while. The result is an amazing interactive dashboard uploaded on my PowerBI Pro workspace where you can analyse dozens of statistics with a single click. Click on a batsman score in a pie chart to see how he performed with respect to SR, Runs, 4s and 6s and more.

The project is still not complete since a dataset of this size needs justice by having more and more statistics and answering questions. I will try to update the project whenever possible.


## Nike Performance Analysis - Excel, Tableau and PowerBI

I recently worked on this short project, highlighting Nike's global performance across various markets and product segments. Finding the data was a hard task, since I could not find everything at a single source. Hence, I had to find data from various points, make it consistent and then run up visualisations.

Key Insights from this project: Nike sportswear is the best performing product, which recorded growth even during the pandemic, when other categories suffered losses. This can be linked to the fact that many non athletes starting doing regular exercises to stay fit in the pandemic.

<img width="1234" alt="Screenshot 2022-04-09 at 22 18 24" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/162590302-6f7e7d1b-f853-4f19-9966-de761a450fc4.png">


North America is a stagnant market, showing signs of decline. Europe and China are key market, showing strong upward trend. North America still has the largest percentage of sales but europe is quickly catching to that number.

<img width="1219" alt="Screenshot 2022-04-09 at 22 18 39" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/162590311-b912f228-844d-43d3-b711-dee530f59019.png">



Wholesale is the best performing channel. Nike has consistently outperformed key competitors, Puma and Adidas, keeping the market leader position to itself

## Customer Analytics Using Python

Recently, I came across an interesting project, where Python is used for customer analytics on a variety of use cases ranging from acquisition, attrition, grouping, etc.

In this project, I have tackled 3 major use cases.

1. K Means Clustering (Unsupervised) to group problem types

In this use case, we have used K Means algorithm to group customer problems. The data provided was a list of problems and the time/resources spent to resolve them. We classify these problems into clusters using the key data such as count, time for response, reoccurence, etc.

Since [K means] (https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-6a6e67336aa1) requires you to provide the number of clusters in the beginning, and without having an idea of it, it might be challenging to identify the optinmal size. To resolve this, I used the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters.


<img width="1192" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 13 59 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/209469194-9a386f0b-8ca1-475f-ab4d-3e8a9368ba53.png">

After this, I fit and predict my model and analyse them using certain Blox Plots.
<img width="1100" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 13 59 12" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/209469213-e78290f3-3712-44ad-af9c-5472fac288d4.png">

Once the model is ready and accurate, I check how the problems in my training data has been classified into groups.

Finally, I use the model to predict the groups for new incoming customer problems.
<img width="1081" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 13 59 17" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/209469251-bc9b08a8-a622-496d-9dfa-9704af2458a5.png">


2. Linear Regression Analysis to Identify Customer Lifetime Values for new Customers

In this use case, we predict the Customer Lifetime Value CLV for new customers based on their initial purchase history using [Linear Regression] (https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/what-is-linear-regression/)
We create the model using our predictions and target training and testing data. We use r2 score to identify the accuracy.
<img width="1224" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 14 20 59" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48427733/209469692-4b7fbcb6-2560-44d3-a1a9-8f5be12b0e15.png">


We finally input fresh data to identify the CLV based on the model.
