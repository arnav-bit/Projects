Recently, as part of my college cirriculum, I worked on a project to Detect Weak Signals in the Gaming Industry. This project was sponsored by Ubisoft.

Thus, we had to explore gaming content, UGC and other data sources to detect trends that are not popular now but have a potential to be a major trend in the next 5-10 years, thus giving companies sufficient time to develop expertise in order to capitalize on the trends.

For the project, I performed the following steps:

1. Scraped data from 21 subreddits using PRAW (API for Python-Reddit)
2. Cleaned, preprocessed and transformed the data, to make it ready for analysis
3. Analsyed this textual content, used NLP to create tokenization, TF-IFD, wordcloud building, sentiment analysis and more.

I have added the scraping code as well as the analysis code.
